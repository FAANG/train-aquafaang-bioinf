# DiffBind Practical

The container to run the practical is in `containers/rstudio_aquafaang`
with instructions for running the image and logging in to rstudio. There
are also instructions to set up an equivalent environment locally, which
is probably easier if you want to do extended analysis.

The Rmd from the tutorial is provided alongside the data on the [Ensembl FTP]().
In order to run the master document, copy it into the folder and load
it into RStudio.

Any questions about setting this up feel free to email malcolm@ebi.ac.uk.
